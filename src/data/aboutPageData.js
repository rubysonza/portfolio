            "I am a web designer and developer fueled by a deep-seated passion for learning, creating, and inspiring. For me, the web is not just about code and pixels; it's a powerful medium for building bridges between ideas and people. My goal is to craft digital experiences that are not only visually engaging but are so intuitive and helpful that they become a seamless part of a user’s daily life.",
            "My creative process is rooted in curiosity and active research. I strive to understand the ‘why’ behind a user’s needs, allowing me to build upon that knowledge and develop ideas with purpose. I believe the most successful websites are the ones that solve real problems and create a genuine, positive impact. It is this mission-to develop applications that truly matter to people-that drives me forward every single day.",

        content: [
            "My web design and development journey started at Rutgers University, building my first sites on Wix and WordPress for I.T. class projects. Despite being new to design, I found that my experience as a lifelong internet user gave me an intuitive sense for what worked (and what really didn't).",
            "That spark of curiosity led me to an intro to web design course that served as a revelation of the career I want to pursue. The challenge of arranging elements on a page while debugging a stubborn bit of JavaScript was the perfect blend of artistry and problem-solving I didn’t know I was looking for. It was then I knew I had found my calling: to not just use the web, but to build and create for it."
